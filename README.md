Making Nix Accessible for everyone


Basic idea is to make nix accessible for non-tech users. Users don't want to keep pushing their dotfiles to cloud as soon as they add a new package on their system, they expect their local packages get automatically synced with the nix configurations on cloud. 

### Nix Problems

- Steep learning curve: Migrating to nix might be helpful for your organization in a long run but this migration might come with some heavy costs. The learning curve of nix and the various new concepts introduced are new for Software developers and even for the DevOps guys. We can focus on nix technicals but to let non-tech people enjoy the nix privileges, we need to make the nix setup process user friendly.
